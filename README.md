# AI-minmax
 Simple game (MinMax algorithm) in C.

On a table there are initially M red cubes and M green cubes (M is a program parameter, eg. M = 10). Each player can take from the table:
i)one cube
ii)exactly K1 red cubes (as long there are at least K1 cubes on the table). K1 is a program parameter and it applies 1 < K1 < M.
iii)exactly K2 green cubes (as long there are at least K1 cubes on the table). K2 is a program parameter and it applies 1 < K2 < M.
The winner is the one who takes the last cube from the table.
